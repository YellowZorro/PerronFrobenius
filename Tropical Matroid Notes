Tropical Matroid Notes

Graphical Matroids
G -> M(G)
elements: edges
bases: spanning trees
circuits: simple cycles
M(G)_w = max weight spanning trees
rank: maximal intersection with a spanning tree
rank(G): size of max spanning tree

M_w takes a face of P_M maximized by vector w

w weight vector on edges
	edge -> |R

Tropical Linear Spaces

The Dressian of M is the set of functions w: B -> R
	such that for any price vector, the subdivisions induced by w forms a matroid

	The matroid base polytope is subdivided into matroid polytopes

Trop Lin Space (M) = 
	trop(M)
	w in R^n st M_w has no loops (rank-1 circuits)

trop(U_(d+1)(n+1)) is union of positive orthants spanned by d-subsets of coordinate vectors

d = 0 is trivial, trop(M) = {c*(111):c in R}

U_(23) - trop(M) = span(e0) U span(e1) U span(e2)
